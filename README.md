## Explore US Bikeshare Data project
### Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data
This project uses Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data. Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

### Statistics Computed

In this project, the code is written to provide the following information:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
  - most common month
  - most common day of week
  - most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip
  - most common start station
  - most common end station
  - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration
  - total travel time
  - average travel time

4. User info
  - counts of each user type
  - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) 
  - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Requirements:

* Language: Python 3.6 or above
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, time
